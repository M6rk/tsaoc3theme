                <p>We support individuals and families who are experiencing crisis through our Casework Empowerment

                    that helps people move toward stability and long-term goals.
                    As part of that support, we offer clothing vouchers and other practical resources to participants
                    based on their specific needs. These vouchers allow individuals to select items from our Thrift
                    Store at no cost to them, ensuring they receive what’s most appropriate for their situation.
                    While we aren’t able to match donations directly to individuals due to privacy and logistical
                    reasons, your donation does directly support people in crisis through this voucher system. Every
                    item you give helps us provide dignity and choice to those we serve.</p>
