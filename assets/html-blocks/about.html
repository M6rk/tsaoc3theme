        <h3 class="section-subtitle">A Brief History of The Salvation Army</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The Salvation Army is an integral part of the Christian Church, although distinctive in government and
                practice. The Army's doctrine follows the mainstream of Christian belief, and its articles of faith
                emphasise God's saving purposes. Its objects are 'the advancement of the Christian religion… of
                education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of
                mankind as a whole.'*</p>

            <p>The movement, founded in 1865 by William Booth, has spread from London, England, to many parts of the
                world.</p>

            <p>The rapid deployment of the first Salvationists was aided by the adoption of a quasi-military command
                structure in 1878 when the title, 'The Salvation Army', was brought into use. A similarly practical
                organisation today enables resources to be equally flexible. Responding to a recurrent theme in
                Christianity, which sees the Church engaged in spiritual warfare, the Army has used to advantage certain
                soldierly features such as uniforms, flags, and ranks to identify, inspire and regulate its endeavours.
            </p>

            <p>Evangelistic and social enterprises are maintained, under the authority of the General, by full-time
                officers and employees, as well as soldiers who give service in their free time. The Army also benefits
                from the support of many adherents and friends, including those who serve on advisory boards.</p>

            <p>Leadership in the Army is provided by commissioned officers who are recognised ministers of religion.</p>

            <p>All Salvationists accept a disciplined and compassionate life of high moral standards which includes
                abstinence from alcohol and tobacco. From its earliest days the Army has accorded women equal
                opportunities, every rank and service being open to them and from childhood the young are encouraged to
                love and serve God.</p>

            <p>Raised to evangelise, the Army spontaneously embarked on schemes for the social betterment of the poor.
                Such concerns have since developed, wherever the Army operates, in practical, skilled and cost-effective
                ways. Evolving social services meet endemic needs and specific crises worldwide. Modern facilities and
                highly-trained staff are employed.</p>

            <p>The need for modern facilities and longer-term development is under continual review. Increasingly, the
                Army's policy and its indigenous membership allow it to cooperate with international relief agencies and
                governments alike.</p>

            <p>The movement's partnership with both private and public philanthropy will continue to bring comfort to
                the needy, while the proclamation of God's redemptive love offers individuals and communities the
                opportunity to enjoy a better life on earth and a place in Christ's everlasting Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The Salvation Army is currently led by General Brian Peddle who is a Canadian, originally from the
                province of Newfoundland and Labrador.</p>

        <h3 class="section-subtitle">History of the Salvation Army in Canada</h3>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The Salvation Army began its work in Canada in 1882, just fifteen years after Confederation, and quickly
                began giving hope to those in need in this country and around the world.</p>

            <p>The first open-air 'meetings' began in Toronto in January 1882. These were led by British immigrants who
                had known the Army in their homeland. Official Salvation Army operations began in July of that year when
                Major Thomas Moore arrived from the U.S. headquarters to take charge. By then, there were eleven 'corps'
                or church congregations in Ontario, and a year later, Canada was declared an independent 'Territory'
                responsible for its own governance within the worldwide organization.</p>

            <p>From the beginning, the Army in Canada adopted founder William Booth's philosophy that there is little
                point in preaching 'salvation' to hungry people. And so the concept of 'soup and salvation' took hold,
                later to be developed into the comprehensive social service programs The Salvation Army operates today,
                many of them in partnership with government.</p>

            <p>But when the Army came to Canada, there was much opposition to its methods from civic politicians and
                other entrenched interests in the early days, and Salvationists were often beaten and jailed for their
                activities. Eventually, the church was accepted as it demonstrated the social benefits that accrued from
                its activities. The men's social work began in 1890 with a Prison Gate Home in Toronto. The first
                Maternity home was opened in Saint John, N.B., in 1898. In 1901, The Salvation Army recommended to the
                federal government that a prisoner probation system be adopted, leading to Canada's first parole
                program. In 1908, salvage work (now called recycling) began in Toronto, leading to the well-known Thrift
                Stores.</p>

            <p>Innovation in social services continued even as the organization matured: the first seniors' residence,
                or Eventide Home, was opened in Edmonton in 1926, and Grace Hospitals were opened in major cities across
                the country, as were homes for unmarried mothers.</p>

            <p>Canadian Salvationists now formally worship in 11 languages and provide services in many others. In the
                post-war years, further social service innovations included an anti-suicide bureau and victim witness
                assistance programs, the latter eventually being absorbed by the criminal justice system.</p>

            <p>The Salvation Army is now the largest non-governmental direct provider of social services in the country.
                It strives to give hope and support to vulnerable people today and every day in 400 communities across
                Canada and more than 132 countries around the world. The Salvation Army offers practical assistance for
                children and families, often tending to the basic necessities of life, provides shelter for homeless
                people and rehabilitation for people who have lost control of their lives to an addiction.</p>

            <p>Today in Canada, The Salvation Army has 667 active officers (clergy), more than 16,000 soldiers (church
                members) and over 31,000 adherents, that is, people who claim the Army as their church home but who are
                not formal members. There are 285 churches and more than 330 social-service institutions of various
                kinds. As well as the many thousands of volunteers, more than 9,000 people are employed by The Salvation
                Army in the Canada and Bermuda Territory.</p>
